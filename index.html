Contactless Palmprint Recognition: A Novel Device, A New Benchmark, and A

<span lang="en-us"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size: 13pt">To make the 
palmprint-based recognition systems more user-friendly and sanitary, researchers 
have been investigating how to design such systems in a contactless manner. 
Though some efforts have been devoted, it is still not quite clear about the 
discriminant power of the contactless palmprint, mainly owing to lack of a 
public, large-scale, and high-quality benchmark dataset collected using a 
well-designed device. As an attempt to fill this gap, we have at first developed 
a highly user-friendly device for capturing high-quality contactless palmprint 
images. Then, a large-scale palmprint dataset is collected. For the first time, 
the quality of collected images is analyzed using modern image quality 
assessment metrics. Furthermore, for contactless palmprint identification, we 
have proposed a novel approach,namely CR CompCode, which can achieve high 
recognition accuracy while having an extremely low computational complexity.</font></span></p>

Palmprint Dataset</font></b></span></p>
<p>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size: 13pt">In order to 
investigate the discriminant capability of the contactless palmprint, we have at 
first devised and developed a novel contactless palmprint acquisition device, 
whose complete 3D CAD model is shown in Fig. 1(a). Its internal structure can be 
clearly observed from the 3D model shown in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(c) shows a photo 
of our device being used by a subject. The device's metal housing comprises two 
parts. Its lower part encloses a CCD camera (JAI AD-80 GE), a lens, a ring white 
LED light source, a power regulator for the light source, and an industrial 
computer. There is a square &quot;imaging hole&quot;' on the top cover of the housing's 
lower part, whose center is on the optical axis of the lens. The size of the 
hole is 230mm*230mm. The housing's upper part is wedge-shaped, on which a thin 
LCD with a touch screen is mounted. The height of our device is about 950mm and 
can be comfortably used by a normal adult. For data acquisition, the user needs 
to present his/her hand above the &quot;imaging hole&quot;. The user can move his/her hand 
up and down freely within the space bounded by the housing's upper part and 
he/she can observe in real-time the camera's video stream from the LCD to adjust 
the hand's pose.</font></span></p>

<span lang="en-us"><font face="Calibri" style="font-size: 13pt">Our newly 
developed device has the following characteristics. At first, as it is of high 
user friendliness, the user will feel comfortable when using it. The whole 
design is in accordance with ergonomics and we pay much attention to details. 
For example, all LEDs are enclosed in the housing, preventing them from hurting 
the user's eyes. Moreover, an LCD is mounted on the top cover, from which the 
user can observe the camera's video stream in real time. That can guide the user 
to adjust the hand pose and also can help alleviate the user's anxiety when 
using our equipment. Secondly, as we carefully adjusted the configurations of 
the camera, the lens, and the light source, the acquired images are of high 
quality, meaning that they have high contrast and high signal-to-noise ratio. 
Four sample palmprint images collected using our device are shown in Fig. 2, 
from which it can be seen that even minute creases on the palmprints can be 
observed. Thirdly, with our device, the collected palmprint image can have a 
simple dark background because it is acquired against the dark back of the LCD. 
A simple background can largely reduce the complexity of the data processing 
afterwards and accordingly can improve the system's robustness.</font></span></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 13pt" face="Calibri">Using the developed device, we 
have established a large-scale contactless palmprint image dataset. As our 
device is straightforward to use, the only instruction given to the subject is 
that he/she needs to stretch his/her hand naturally to make sure the finger gaps 
can be clearly observed on the screen. In our dataset, images were collected 
from 300 volunteers, including 192 males and 108 females. Among them, 235 
subjects were 20~30 years old and the others were 30~50 years old. We collected 
samples in two separate sessions. In each session, the subject was asked to 
provide 10 images for each palm. Therefore, 40 images from 2 palms were 
collected from each subject. In total, the database contains 12,000 images 
captured from 600 different palms. The average time interval between the first 
and the second sessions was about 61 days. The maximum and minimum time 
intervals were 106 days and 21 days, respectively.</font></p>

dataset can be downloaded here. <a href="http://pan.baidu.com/s/1hrLeYDA">Original

<p><font face="Calibri" style="font-weight: 700" size="4">ROI images extracted 
using our algorithm are also released. <a href="http://pan.baidu.com/s/1cu3aaE">ROI Images</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calibri" style="font-size: 13pt">Naming convention. In the 
dataset, there are two folders, &quot;session1&quot; and &quot;session2&quot;. &quot;session1&quot; contains 
images collected in the first session while &quot;session2&quot; comprises images 
collected in the second session. Two images in &quot;session1&quot; and &quot;session2&quot; having 
the same name were collected from the same palm. In each session, &quot;00001~00010&quot;&nbsp; 
were from the first palm, &quot;00011~00020&quot; were from the second palm, and so on. 
So, in each session, 6000 images were collected from 600 different palms. For each image in the 
&quot;Original Images&quot;, you can find its corresponding ROI image in &quot;ROI images&quot;.</font></p>
